# 5509 Supervised Learning Final Project:
# Predicting Automobile Insurance Claims 

## Project Topic

The project looks at the utility of a LinearSVM versus two non-parametric classifiers (random forest and KNN) for predicting automobile insurance claims. With increased ability to predict the likelihood of claims, insurers could optimize premiums to increase profits or *ideally* reduce costs to customers less likely to have claims.

## Data

This project is based off a dataset posted to Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifteshanajnin/carinsuranceclaimprediction-classification). The dataset consists of features relating to the policy holder (age, location, etc.) and features relating to the car itself. The dataset includes a binary label indicating whether or not the policy holder placed a claim within six months of the data point. 

The data is contained in a single .csv file and translates to a dataframe of over 58,000 rows and a mix of roughly 15 numerical features and almost 30 categorical features.
